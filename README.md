# three

Why did you choose this subject?
I chose Three.js because I like visualization and graphics

How were you first made aware of it?
I just learned about it today in the lesson options

What problem does it solve?
Using 3D visualization to create more dynamic websites

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Creating a library to use in JavaScript to create your own stunning designs

Why does one use it?
An interior design company could use it to visually plan out a design in a given area.  An audio design company might use it to conceptually plan sound design for a given venue.

What are the alternatives?
None that I know of

What is it similar to, if anything?
Any graphics design program

What is the history of this technology?

Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello to GitHub in April 2010. The origins of the library can be traced back to his involvement with the demoscene in the early 2000s. The code was first developed in ActionScript, then in 2009 ported to JavaScript. In Cabello's mind, the two strong points for the transfer to JavaScript were not having to compile the code before each run and platform independence. With the advent of WebGL, Paul Brunt was able to add the renderer for this quite easily as Three.js was designed with the rendering code as a module rather than in the core itself. Cabello's contributions include API design, CanvasRenderer, SVGRenderer and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project.

Who built it and why?
See above answer

Who is maintaining it?
There are over 650 contributors in total.

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
I love it.  I think it is a great library for creating compelling websites or even design tools.
